Publishist/Publi Éist
====================

The certifiably easiest way to manage your entire publication lifecycle, from
submission, to review, to publication, to sales.

Running the dev environment
---------------------------

This repo was built with [Yeoman]. It's just a basic web app, very little
javascript, but it's nice to be able to write Jade (similar to Haml, but for
node) templates and Coffeescript.

To run the dev environment, run `grunt server` from the project directory. To
bundle it all up for production, run `grunt build`.
