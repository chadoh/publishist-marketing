      <h2>No One Enjoys Setting Up DNS</h2>
      <p>When you first get started with Publishist, you'll have a brand new website at a domain like "<span class="subdomain">example</span>.publishist.com". If you own your own domain (for example, let's say you own "www.<span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com") and you want to point it at your Publishist website, you'll need to configure DNS.</p>
      <p>
        To set up DNS, it helps to know a little bit about how it works. If
        you already know a good bit, feel free to skip to&nbsp;<a href="#the-setup">the next section.</a>

      <h3 id="dns-primer">A Wee Primer On DNS</h3>
      <p>
        Websites live on servers. A server is just a computer that has
        constant access to the internet, and is specially-configured to hand
        out web pages (that is, to "serve" web pages).
      </p>
      <p>
        A website address like "publishist.com" is called a "domain name".
        Domain names are great for humans, but computers don't know how to use
        them. In order for your computer to talk to a server (some computer on
        the other side of the internet), it needs to know that server's IP
        address.
      </p>
      <p>Think of an IP address as a computer's phone number. When you type in "<span class="subdomain">example</span>.publishist.com", your computer needs to figure out the phone number
        of that server. Then your computer asks that server for a web page, and
        the server creates the page and sends it back to you across the internet.
      </p>
      <p>The way your computer figures out the phone number (IP address) of the server you want is the&nbsp;<b>D</b>omain&nbsp;<b>N</b>ame&nbsp;<b>S</b>ystem. There are a whole bunch of computers that just store phonebooks for the internet, mapping domain names like www.<span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com to IP addresses. These are called Domain Name Servers. When
        you enter a URL in your browser or click a link on a website, your
        computer asks these DNS servers to look up the IP address of the
        desired server, and then goes and fetches your web page from that
        server.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-setup">Configuring Your Custom Domain On Publishist</h2>
      <p>There are a few steps to get your Publishist website responding to your very own domain.</p>
      <h3 id="step-1">1. Register A Domain Name</h3>
      <p>You'll need to own a domain name in order to use it with Publishist. Publishist does not provide this service, but we recommend these registrars:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.name.com/">Name.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.gandi.net/">Gandi</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please do NOT use GoDaddy. GoDaddy are a smarmy company that have poor customer service and want to censor the internet. If you've already registered a domain with them, consider switching.</p>
      <h3 id="step-2">2. Make Sure Your DNS Provider Is Fancy Enough</h3>
      <p>
        Your registrar from the previous step will probably let you configure
        your DNS settings. However, you don't need to use their DNS tools. It's
        likely that their DNS tools are pretty limited.
      </p>
      <p>Any DNS service will let you complete&nbsp;<a href="#step-3">step 3</a>, however, to complete&nbsp;<a href="#step-4">step 4</a>&nbsp;you'll need one with some advanced capabilities. You're welcome
        to not complete step 4, if you'd rather not bother and don't need the
        functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific functionality you need is the ability to add a type of
        record sometimes called "HTTPRED", "ALIAS", or "Redirect". Here are some
        DNS services that allow this and what they call the record type:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple</a>&nbsp;provides an ALIAS record</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/">DNS Made Easy</a>&nbsp;provides an HTTPRED record</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.zerigo.com/managed-dns">Zerigo DNS</a>&nbsp;provides a Redirect record</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We recommend signing up with one of these services. Once you're signed
        up, you'll need to tell your registrar (from&nbsp;<a href="#step-1">step 1</a>) to use these new, alternate domain name servers, instead of their
        own. Your new DNS service will provide instructions on how to do this.
      </p>
      <h3 id="step-3">3. Map www.<span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com to&nbsp;<span class="subdomain">example</span>.publishist.com</h3>
      <p>OK! Now onto the easy part! Log in to your DNS provider and add new DNS record. You want to add a CNAME record pointing "www.<span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com" (or whatever your domain is) to&nbsp;<b><span class="subdomain">example</span>.publishist.com</b>&nbsp;(or whatever URL you use to get to your Publishist site).</p>
      <p>
        That's it! Once you've done this, it may take some time for your
        changes to make it onto all the other domain name servers across the
        internet. Sometimes it can take a couple days. But once your changes
        have propogated, you can visit your custom domain to get to your
        Publishist website!
      </p>
      <h3 id="step-4">4. Redirect&nbsp;<span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com to www.<span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com</h3>
      <p>
        People often don't type the "www." part of URLs. If you want people
        to be able to type in your web address without the "www", you'll need
        a fancy DNS service as described in&nbsp;<a href="#step-2">step 2</a>. Otherwise, if they forget to type the "www", they'll get an error
        or a totally different page.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a DNS service that allows it, add an Alias, HTTPRED, or
        Redirect record pointing from&nbsp;<b><span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com</b>&nbsp;(or whatever your custom domain is) to&nbsp;<b>www.<span class="subdomain">example</span>mag.com</b>&nbsp;(your same custom domain, but with "www").
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this change propogates across the internet, you should be able
        to type in just your root domain and get redirected to your "www"
        domain, which points to your Publishist site! Huzzah! All done.
