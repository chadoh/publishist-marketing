          Publishist aims to promote open communities of people who joyfully
          create more than they consume. We hope to be a mechanism by which
          creators are lovingly critiqued and championed by their community
          (because no one grows in a vacuum), and by which the best works are
          given appropriate promotion above all the noise. We believe in the
          ability of localized communities to produce artists who produce
          creations on par with the best creations of history.
